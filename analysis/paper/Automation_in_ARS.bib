	abstract = {Remote sensing has been successfully used in the past for the exposure of shallow buried antiquities. The detection of these
remains is mainly based on the photo interpretation of high-resolution satellite or aerial imagery. This procedure is focused on the
identification of crop marks using visible and near infrared (VNIR) spectrum response (e.g. vegetation indices), which is sensitive
to vegetation stress. Although several studies are usually performed based on adequate spatial resolution datasets, the use of freely
available satellite data or ground spectral signatures for the detection of crop marks is quite limited. This study presents three differ-
ent approaches and case studies on the use of such remote sensing in archaeological applications. The first part introduces the so-call
‘Archaeological Index’, an index sensitive to crop marks developed for detecting archaeological antiquities based on the optimal spec-
tral bands of satellite images. This is followed by an image-based method intended for the detection of crop marks using satellite data
of inadequate spatial resolution (medium spatial resolution). Finally, the potential applications of the forthcoming European Space
Agency‘s (ESA) satellite sensor, Sentinel-2, for archaeological studies is examined. The results outlined here reveal the potential use of
satellite remote sensing and ground spectroscopy for the identification of buried archaeological remains through crop marks.},

	abstract = {Multisource remote sensing data acquisition has been increased in the last years due to technological improvements and decreased acquisition cost of remotely sensed data and products. This study attempts to fuse different types of prospection data acquired from dissimilar remote sensors and explores new ways of interpreting remote sensing data obtained from archaeological sites. Combination and fusion of complementary sensory data does not only increase the detection accuracy but it also increases the overall performance in respect to recall and precision. Moving beyond the discussion and concerns related to fusion and integration of multisource prospection data, this study argues their potential (re)use based on Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) fusion models. The archaeological site of V\&eacute;sztő-M\&aacute;gor Tell in the eastern part of Hungary was selected as a case study, since ground penetrating radar (GPR) and ground spectral signatures have been collected in the past. GPR 20 cm depth slices results were correlated with spectroradiometric datasets based on neural network models. The results showed that the BNN models provide a global correlation coefficient of up to 73\%\&mdash;between the GPR and the spectroradiometric data\&mdash;for all depth slices. This could eventually lead to the potential re-use of archived geo-prospection datasets with optical earth observation datasets. A discussion regarding the potential limitations and challenges of this approach is also included in the paper.},

	abstract = {Archaeologists have been aware of the potential of satellite imagery as a tool almost since thefirst Earth remote sensing satellite. Initially sensors such as Landsat had a ground resolution which was too coarse for thorough archaeological prospection although the imagery wasused for geo-archaeological and enviro-archaeological analyses. In the intervening years thespatial and spectral resolution of these sensing devices has improved. In recent years twoimportant occurrences enhanced the archaeological applicability of imagery from satelliteplatforms: The declassification of high resolution photography by the American and Russiangovernments and the deregulation of commercial remote sensing systems allowing thecollection of sub metre resolution imagery. This thesis aims to evaluate the archaeological application of three potentially importantresources: Corona space photography and Ikonos panchromatic and multispectral imagery. These resources are evaluated in conjunction with Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery over a 600 square km study area in the semi-arid environment around Homs, Syria. Thearchaeological resource in this area is poorly understood, mapped and documented. The images are evaluated for their ability to create thematic layers and to locatearchaeological residues in different environmental zones. Further consideration is given tothe physical factors that allow archaeological residues to be identified and how satelliteimagery and modern technology may impact on Cultural Resource Management. This research demonstrates that modern high resolution and historic satellite imagery can beimportant tools for archaeologists studying in semi-arid environments. The imagery hasallowed a representative range of archaeological features and landscape themes to beidentified. The research shows that the use of satellite imagery can have significant impact onthe design of the archaeological survey in the middle-east and perhaps in other environments.},

	abstract = {In common with all domains of remote sensing, residues indicative of past human activity can only be detected if they exhibit some form of identifiable contrast with their surroundings. Unlike many other domains these residues do not exhibit consistent spectral signatures. Archaeological spectral responses are commonly expressed as subtle deviations from their surrounding matrix. This is true for crop marks, soil marks and thermal anomalies. The challenge is to collect imagery when the contrast between archaeological residues and the background matrix is maximized and thus to find algorithms that will enhance these sometimes subtle distinctions so that they can be more readily detected. This paper will present work undertaken in the semi-arid environment of Homs, Syria. The project area includes two contrasting environmental zones with a differing repertoire of archaeological remains: a basalt zone (120 km$^{\textrm{2}}$) and a marl zone (480 km$^{\textrm{2}}$). Declassified Corona space photography and Ikonos satellite imagery (panchromatic and multispectral) were evaluated to determine their efficacy for detecting a range of different archaeological residues. No single image set was able to provide the best result for the two zones, as each required imagery collected under different environmental conditions.},

Historical aerial photographs, in particular, often contain important data, especially where recent landscape change has drastically altered topography. Within the current study area, focussed upon the alluvial landscape surrounding the ancient city of Butrint in southern Albania, late 20th century agricultural intensification has obliterated topographical features relating to earlier land-use within the valley. However, through recourse to earlier aerial photographic images and the development of an image analysis procedure utilizing Radon transforms, a study of relic landscape divisions relating to the Roman settlement and land-use at Butrint has been possible. The analytical procedure described allows the rapid, automated detection of linear alignments relating to the orientation of the settlement over large spatial areas. The resulting data were imported into a GIS, allowing measurements between surviving linear elements to be made and regular patterns of land division or centuriation deduced. The study revealed the surviving remnants of a centuriation pattern composed primarily of 20 actus divisions, while a further possibly earlier pattern was also detected, based upon 16 by 24 actus divisions.},

The project is based on what I term “brute force” methods, relying on systematic exploration of imagery by trained analysts, and has now successfully created a database of more than 14,000 sites, some 10,000 of which are previously undocumented. Results of the project highlight the need for human intervention to make any archaeological discovery meaningful, suggesting that imagery analysis, like any act of archaeological investigation, requires an engaged, thoughtful and creative scholar.},

	abstract = {In this paper, airborne hyperspectral data have been exploited by means of Nonlinear Principal Component Analysis (NLPCA) to test their effectiveness as a tool for archaeological prospection, evaluating their potential for detecting anomalies related to buried archaeological structures. In the literature, the NLPCA was used to decorrelate the information related to a hyperspectral image. The resulting nonlinear principal components (NLPCs) contain information related to different land cover types and biophysical properties, such as vegetation coverage or soil wetness. From this point of view, NLPCA applied to airborne hyperspectral data was exploited to test their effectiveness and capability in highlighting the anomalies related to buried archaeological structures. Each component obtained from the NLPCA has been interpreted in order to assess any tonal anomalies. As a matter of a fact, since every analyzed component exhibited anomalies different in terms of size and intensity, the Separability Index (SI) was applied for measuring the tonal difference of the anomalies with respect to the surrounding area. SI has been evaluated for determining the potential of anomalies detection in each component. The airborne Multispectral Infrared and Visible Imaging Spectrometer (MIVIS) images, collected over the archaeological Park of Selinunte, were analyzed for this purpose. In this area, the presence of remains, not yet excavated, was reported by archaeologists. A previous analysis of this image, carried out to highlight the buried structures, appear to match the archaeological prospection. The results obtained by the present work demonstrate that the use of the NLPCA technique, compared to previous approaches emphasizes the ability of airborne hyperspectral images to identify buried structures. In particular, the adopted data processing flow chart (i.e., NLPCA and SI techniques, data resampling criteria and anomaly evaluations criteria) applied to MIVIS airborne hyperspectral data, collected over Selinunte Archaeological Park, highlighted the ability of the NLPCA technique in emphasizing the anomalies related to the presence of buried structure.},

	abstract = {Object-based image analysis (OBIA) has been increasingly used to identify terrain features of archaeological sites, but only recently to extract subsurface archaeological features from geophysical data. In this study, we use a semi-automated OBIA to identify Archaic (8000\&ndash;1000 BC) hearths from Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) data collected at David Crockett Birthplace State Park in eastern Tennessee in the southeastern United States. The data were preprocessed using GPR-SLICE, Surfer, and Archaeofusion software, and amplitude depth slices were selected that contained anomalies ranging from 0.80 to 1.20 m below surface (BS). Next, the data were segmented within ESRI ArcMap GIS software using a global threshold and, after vectorization, classified using four attributes: area, perimeter, length-to-width ratio, and Circularity Index. The user-defined parameters were based on an excavated Archaic circular hearth found at a depth greater than one meter, which consisted of fire-cracked rock and had a diameter greater than one meter. These observations were in agreement with previous excavations of hearths at the site. Features that had a high probability of being Archaic hearths were further delineated by human interpretation from radargrams and then ground-truthed by auger testing. The semi-automated OBIA successfully predicted 15 probable Archaic hearths at depths ranging from 0.85 to 1.20 m BS. Observable spatial clustering of hearths may indicate episodes of seasonal occupation by small mobile groups during the Archaic Period.},

	abstract = {In recent research using prehistoric archaeological site data from the Delaware Coastal Plain we have developed techniques to apply Landsat remote sensing data to the generation of archaeological predictive models. Rather than focusing on the specific sensing of archaeological sites, we use a synoptic approach that delineates the likely environmental settings for archaeological sites. The logistical regression statistical technique provides a quantitative link between site locations and environmental variables. By analyzing the environmental variables associated with known site locations, and known non-site locations, the logistical regression provides a probability assessment of an unsurveyed area's potential for containing archaeological sites. Supervised classification of Landsat data generates maps of environmental zones that can be related to the environmental variables used in the logistical regression. The model and the Landsat classifications have been subjected to preliminary tests and they provide accurate assessments of site potential in unsurveyed areas, as well as measures of the accuracy of the assessments. Results can be applied to cultural resource management problems and also yield useful data on prehistoric land use patterns.},

	abstract = {Automatic extraction of cartographic features from aerial or satellite images is an important issue of recent research primarily for their potential use in geographic information systems (GIS) and for creating archaeological sites prediction models. The view from above allows to recognize archaeological features, not visible on the ground, by the analysis of crops variations in an expanded spatial context. Automatic algorithms would be very useful to support archaeologists during the time consuming task of visual interpretation and the manual digitalization of large aerial images.
In this paper we present some automatic and semi-automatic approaches for trace extraction, based on different methodologies such as active contours and statistical analysis. The application of standard image analysis procedures for trace extraction is generally unsuccessfull due to their frequent poor visibility, intricate texture, background inhomogeneity, not well-defined boundaries, similarity with other image artefacts. Therefore, the identification and digitalization of an archaeological trace requires more sophisticated methods inspired by the human visual system which use simultaneously all the informations such as colour and features together with domain knowledge to interpret the scene. Starting from methodologies applied with success in different applicative contexts we have modified and adapted these approaches to include the domain knowledge of archaeological trace extraction and reduce the search space in selected spatial area. Different experiments have been carried out on aerial images of the Apulian Tavoliere where a variety of settlements was found such as ancient drainage ditches, Roman centuriations, necropolis, footprints of man-made foundations. Comparisons among methodologies based on manual initialization or automatic approaches have been carried out and discussions about pros and cons are provided.},

	abstract = {Object-based image analysis (OBIA) is a method of assessing remote sensing data that uses morphometric and spectral parameters simultaneously to identify features in remote sensing imagery. Over the past 10–15 years, OBIA methods have been introduced to detect archaeological features. Improvements in accuracy have been attained by using a greater number of morphometric variables and multiple scales of analysis. This article highlights the developments that have occurred in the application of OBIA within archaeology and argues that OBIA is both a useful and necessary tool for archaeological research. Additionally, I discuss future research paths using this method. Some of the suggestions put forth here include: pushing for multifaceted research designs utilizing OBIA and manual interpretation, using OBIA methods for directly studying landscape settlement patterns, and increasing data sharing of methods between researchers.},

	abstract = {One persistent archaeological challenge is the generation of systematic documentation for the extant archaeological record at the scale of landscapes. Often our information for landscapes is the result of haphazard and patchy surveys that stem from opportunistic and historic efforts. Consequently, overall knowledge of some regions is the product of ad hoc survey area delineation, degree of accessibility, effective ground visibility, and the fraction of areas that have survived destruction from development. These factors subsequently contribute unknown biases to our understanding of chronology, settlements patterns, interaction, and exchange. Aerial remote sensing offers one potential solution for improving our knowledge of landscapes. With sensors that include LiDAR, remote sensing can identify archaeological features that are otherwise obscured by vegetation. Object-based image analyses (OBIA) of remote sensing data hold particular promise to facilitate regional analyses thorough the automation of archaeological feature recognition. Here, we explore four OBIA algorithms for artificial mound feature detection using LiDAR from Beaufort County, South Carolina: multiresolution segmentation, inverse depression analysis, template matching, and a newly designed algorithm that combines elements of segmentation and template matching. While no single algorithm proved to be consistently superior to the others, a combination of methods is shown to be the most effective for detecting archaeological features.},
